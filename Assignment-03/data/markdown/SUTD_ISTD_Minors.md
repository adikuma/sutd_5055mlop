### Key Information

* Eligible students from ESD, EPD and CSD majors (students matriculated in AY2017 onwards) may pursue this minor.
* The minor will be accorded upon successful completion of the required subjects by Term 8. No extension beyond Term 8 is allowed.
* Minor students need to ensure that you meet the minor requirements every term. The ISTD Pillar will only do minor eligibility check in Term 7/8, before your graduation.
* Non-CSD students are advised to work out a study plan with your home pillar. This is to ensure that the modules you are going to take fulfil both the AI/CS minor and your home pillar graduation requirements.
* Please check with your home pillar the number of unrestricted electives you are allowed to take from another pillar.
* Students **must** declare their intention to enrol in a minor to the Office of Student Administration at the start of Term 8. Students should note that the add/drop period and related policies apply to minor-related and additional fifth subjects (if any).
