# ESD Specialisation Tracks - Overview

## About ESD Specialisation Tracks

The ESD undergraduate programme has been designed with flexibility in mind, so that students can customise their courses to suit their interests and future careers. Students may choose to follow one of four tracks. These specialisation tracks provide exposure to specific industries and are composed of three elective courses usually taken in terms 6, 7, and 8. Students who complete a specialisation track will have it indicated on their transcript so that future employers can recognise this expertise. Choosing a specialisation track is optional and students are expected to discuss their elective choices with their faculty advisor.
