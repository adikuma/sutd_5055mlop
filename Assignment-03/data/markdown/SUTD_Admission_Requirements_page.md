# Admission Requirements Overview

SUTD’s approach to Admissions is significantly different from most universities. Keep this in mind as you read through this, and please contact us if you have any questions.

## What we look for

### Comprehensive Application Review:
SUTD assesses students holistically – academic, qualities and traits, and portfolios (including but not limited to co-curricular activities).
