# Undergraduate Programme

The Undergraduate programme comprises eight academic terms leading to a Bachelor of Science (Architecture and Sustainable Design) degree. Our unique programme structure and hands-on approach to Architecture confers on our students the necessary mix of hard skills and creative thinking to face future challenges in society and Architecture.

## Overview

Our programme consists of core subjects, electives, capstone, option studios and urban sketching.

## Curriculum Structure

### Core Subjects
- **Design Studio Sequence**: The heart of the programme, focusing on Design Computation, Building Technology, and History, Theory and Culture.

### Electives
- Several electives are offered to address emerging challenges such as critical resource constraints, the need for energy-efficient and livable housing, rapid urbanization, transportation planning, historical conservation and land use transformations.

### Capstone and Option Studios
- The Capstone Studio and the Option Studio represent culminating projects for the Bachelor of Science in Architecture and Sustainable Design programme, offering students the opportunity to work on real-world problems individually and in interdisciplinary and cross-pillar teams.

### Urban Sketching
- Sketching is a way of communication and expression. Urban Sketching is designed to equip students with fundamental sketching skills with a focus on the urban fabrics and landscapes.
