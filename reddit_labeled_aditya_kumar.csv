For hall activity/commitment, you would have to participate in atleast 1 hostel event every term (if I rmbr correctly).. but this is only if you want to apply for hostel after term 2.. if you don't want to, then you can just not go for the hostel events..

For me, I usually hear plane sounds at night (very subtle) when I switch off my fan.. it is not really that prominent.. However, I do have to have admit that those living near the toilet would have problems such as hearing the toilet door getting slammed :( but other than that, not really any other sound issues..

There are quiet hours (don't really rmbr exactly when), but there is absolutely no curfew.. it is all up to you when you want to go to hostel and when not to..

Study areas are vastly available during normal periods, but during exam periods you might have some difficulty finding areas to study.. you can only book certain areas to study.. 

Wifi coverage is pretty good, there are some rare instances when the wifi would be down, but other than that it is pretty good.

May have to pull the occasional late night, but that's expected at any uni.

3. Yes. SUTD is one of the only Uni's where all mods have small classes. Lectures are not a given, meaning content is taught in a small class setting.

1 and 2.   
A tip for you is to learn things smartly. Find a way to do things that you are good at. For example, I usually attend class not doing pre-reading, as I feel I use my time in the most impactful way to accelerate my learning. People scold, but you know yourself the best.  


I also like to organize my thoughts when I listen to lectures, write down what I don't know, and ask my prof after class. A good trait I learned to having a good relationship with my prof, being attentive and asking critical, sometimes stupid, questions, and showing that you are interested in the class (usually I would describe my thought process and how I derive so-and-so conclusion), such that he/she entertains you, know where you are at and you get what you want.  


4.   
Soft skills/non-academics are also essential when working. Having academics will bring you through the interviews and perhaps, a few years down the road. But bear in mind, that the world is always changing, and you gotta learn and relearn new things. Plus, also gotta ask yourself whether you want to be a workaholic after graduation.

k8ridys,"whether SUTD has ""better mental health"" is hugely dependent on the individual - how well you do working in group projects, coping with crammed courses and heavy 5th row involvement.

For groupwork, we do 4-6 group projects every term and all the deadlines are crammed into the same 2-3 weeks. For the courses, we typically cram a lot of content into the 14 weeks because we dont have as much specialisation as NUS and NTU to afford spreading it into 2 separate modules. School is smaller so it gets harder to get committed people in your CCAs (or 5th rows as we call them).

Also its a lot easier to get into SUTD and once you get in, you are guaranteed to get whichever pillar you pick. so its easy to get into CS compared to NUS/NTU. SUTD will consider your CCA and leadership skills, and your portfolio of projects. if you're interested in CS, i suggest making some projects, putting it on github and deploying it.

CSD used to be called ISTD and was only recently renamed in 2022 and I am not sure if there is any changes in course contents to reflect this name change. But essentially the professors teaching CSD will also teach some modules in DAI. The key difference is the Design portion where the professors in Architecture will be the key people teaching. 

Teaching wise, all educators are supposedly trained to conduct lessons where there is alot of hands-on, active learning. So many modules especially the freshies they will be held in a class of not more than 50 students instead of lecture style. in the classroom, there are multiple whiteboards and projectors and whenever possible, the class will breakout into small groups to solve problems or questions. 

Not sure if you know about the big 'D' but it is supposed to integrate design projects in 4 dimensions into the curriculum. So 1D is design projects within modules, 2D is design projects across the same cohort, 3D is across different cohorts, etc. So no matter which degree programme, you will expect a lot of project work.

The key challenge for DAI is that the industry may not fully understand what the course teaches and how it is relevant to the employers and how it compares with traditional Computer Science graduates. Those that do appreciates the DAI graduates, will likely be your only choices for employment - this means you will likely be working with your classmates.

On top of the small campus, limited housing options and availability of food on-campus, it doesn't make a lot of sense to just suddenly take in 2000+ students like they do in other unis faculties.",24-08-2023 02:23,NEU,NEU

1 I mostly buy out but there are people who precook whole weeks meal(meal prep) if your group of friend cooks then you can have meals quite offen

2 Hostel toilets are mostly clean from my experiance dont understand what ""  specific place to like change? "" means. Crowded is based on who stays there if for example most people have morning classes at 8:30 at 8 the toilet will be ""crowed"" (the 4 sinks to brush teeth is occupied) 

3 Laptop offers never heard of this thing before if you have any info I would love to know more. CSD for best bang for buck use the money on a lap top to get a desk PC then screen share it to your old laptop the prossesing power of your PC whould do you great. But I dont know about laptop.

4 fifth rows you need to ask about what cluster are you attending but generaly it is all at night 6-10 can have thing normaly it is like 2 hours? Take more in the 1 sem as it is pass fail unless you have special scheams like me which then 1 sem is not pass fail.

General rule is that 1 sem people get 3-5 fifth rows then cut the commitment to 1 or 2. Balancing see you school stuff is honestly quite managable if you can plan well and not over commit/procrasinate. (you can be more spercific on the fifth rows you want to attend?)

Also you may rage as some things like connecting USB device may be dumb at first as you don't know VM but later it is very simple.

Yes. Mostly freshmore. Based on what I have seen, usually they usually do not have the right study ethics/discipline. For example, there is a distinct difference between ""Oh can I copy your homework?"" Rather than "" oh can I compare your homework?"" And then ask questions to clarify. 

Of course, there are other ways to learn. But uh... Help is available. Professors got help sessions and there are TAs also. You just need to put in effort.

And uh.. you will be surprised on who are people dropping out. They are some from hwa Chong/vjc. So for my freshie class, 3/40. University makes you to be more independent... Much lesser spoon feeding cus diff environment.

There is also another dimension in dropping out. Just don't be a playboy/bastard to everyone. One of the drop outs is being hated by everyone cus of the nasty things he did intentionally and repeatedly despite repeated feedbacks back to him. Hence, no one likes him. That environment hence become bad for him, hence drop out.

Financial help is okay.... If your goal is to be a high flyer but lack the financial capabilities... There are mid term and full scholarship available. I have earned my mid term scholarship by working hard and retaining... So it is sustainable. If you didn't manage to hit it, getting a decent-ish gpa and doing part time is also sustainable. Just really need to manage yourself.

But I must say don't worry so much. If the shit falls on you, take one at a time and slowly. There are shit that seem urgent but they are not really. 

And also, there are different ways of becoming successful. For example, school can be a platform for startup launchpad. School can also be a platform to hone your soft skills, like managing an event, where you can afford to make mistakes. Not getting a good GPA is okay.

jpbtgr0,"HAHA I'm glad you asked! I myself got in through early admission! 

I'm not sure if they've changed anything but here's the process that took place for me.

I got a message from my JC to apply for early admission. I'm not sure about applying on your own, that's just how it happened for me c':

They took a look at my prelim results and then invited me to a workshop to attend. During this workshop they introduced the SUTD curriculum and the SUTD way and culture. It's basically a design thinking workshop that introduces you to important concepts you will learn throughout your SUTD years.

After the workshop, we were grouped up and then went to attend a group interview. My interview was with one interviewer and 3 interviewees. They asked me the usual questions, like where do I see myself in X years. They did also ask about SUTD specific things like whether I like making things and how I tackle a problem I don't have the answer to or have no experience doing.

I've had friends tell me they've had physics and math questions in their interview but I didn't face that so I'm not sure.

After the interview they eventually emailed me saying they wanted to see my A-level results before informing me of my admission results. I did have a U in my prelims so that might have been the reason for that but I can't be too sure.

Just be yourself! The skills and people they're tryna look for are people who are willing to learn and better themselves. People who aren't afraid to fail so that they can learn! For example, I mentioned having no computing education or experience but mentioned I liked watching videos on youtube to learn and have been watching CS50 lectures as well. An appreciation for a holistic education is a plus too. 

All the best and hope to see you in SUTD!",24-06-2023 08:41,POS,POS

jpbhocg,"Current SUTD student here!

I'm happy to help answer your questions about SUTD if you have any but here's my advice for you based on what you're asking.

As some have already mentioned, you don't need to ""qualify"" for CSD, you just need to be accepted into SUTD then you're free to choose whatever course you want during your third term of study.

The important thing to note here is that you're only choosing your course in your third term!! What this means is that courses in terms 1, 2 and 3 (sort of for term 3) are gonna be common for all SUTD students. This includes two compulsory physics mods. I don't mean to scare you but speaking as someone who did take H2 Physics, it's hard af. This is a sentiment shared by many in my cohort. On the bright side, you will be able to take these mods as S/U, or pass fail. This means that these mods won't affect your GPA so long as you pass the mods. That takes away a lot of the pressure of doing well.

I do have friends with no physics background who survived the first two terms then proceeded to do CSD, or any of the other courses where physics isn't a big part. So don't be afraid to give it a go.

What I would like to add on, as an extra piece of advice is, if you're sure you wanna do CS, SUTD is an option but it might not be the best option. SUTD is a place to explore more before truly deciding on what you wanna do. Don't come in with CS tunnel vision! You'll find your first two or three terms a lot less enjoyable that way. Be open to learning about other things and who knows! You might end up choosing Architecture HAHA",24-06-2023 06:02,POS,NEU
jp845m7,Also only took O-level physics but I did the free a level physics courses on brilliant.org for a few weeks before matriculation to catch up. (List of topics should be on the page for SS ILP). Anyway I think they’re mostly relevant for the first term only.,23-06-2023 14:14,POS,NEU

Afaik RP ranges are low 70s to perfect 90 for people who were admitted historically. There may be students with sub-70 RP but I don't know any. 



Physics is not needed for CSD but it is very math heavy, especially very popular mods like machine learning. Physics is needed for your freshmore terms (i.e. term 1 and 2) that everyone will have to take regardless of which pillar you intend to go to.",23-06-2023 14:07,NEU,NEU

They invited me over for my research proposal today. I was given only 2.5 days to prepare for it, but I only started working on it on the second day as I was ill with diarrhea.

Preparing a detailed research proposal and summarizing my previous research experiences at the last minute was incredibly challenging. I had to sift through scientific papers and literature to find a suitable research topic worthy of investigation as well as summarize my previous research work. However, I understand that as a PhD student, we need to work around short deadlines.

The proposal was conducted in the presence of the professor as well as 4 other faculty members.  I am not by any means an exceptional student, lacking extensive research experience and knowledge beyond my previous field of study in biomedical science. In fact, I was surprised they even asked me to present my research proposal (but I believe it was because my Statement Objectives were incredibly well written for the application).
Consequently, it was difficult to address their inquiries and concerns regarding my proposed research and the gaps in my knowledge. Overall, I believe I did not perform particularly well.

While the outcome of the application isn't out yet, I am not quite positive I will get in. Nonetheless, I will provide an update on this thread regarding the final outcome.

Please prepare a draft/idea of your research proposal when you're applying for a PhD program, as it would be best to spend as least 2 days reading up on current literature as well as brainstorm on ideas before drafting research proposal.
