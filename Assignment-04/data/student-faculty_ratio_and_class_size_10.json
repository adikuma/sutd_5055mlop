    "What strategies are in place to foster a sense of community and connection within larger classes, and how effective are these strategies?",
    "How does the student-faculty ratio and class size vary across different departments and colleges within the university?",
    "What is the university's plan for maintaining or improving the student-faculty ratio and class sizes in the face of potential budget cuts or enrollment increases?",
    "Are teaching assistants (TAs) used extensively in courses, and if so, what is their role in instruction and student support?",
