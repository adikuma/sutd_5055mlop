# ESD Curriculum - AY2020 Onwards

## Overview
The ESD undergraduate degree delivers a programme that is broad, with opportunities for acquiring in-depth knowledge in specific application areas. The ESD core consists of rigorous methodology courses, which provide the technical foundation necessary to model, analyse, and manage large-scale complex systems. Students supplement this core by choosing from a variety of elective courses depending on their interests. Students may also specialise in a specific specialisation track by choosing elective courses related to the track.

## By the Numbers

### ESD Core (84 Credits)
- The ESD core is composed of courses focused on various methods for analysis and modelling of engineering systems. These courses are offered every year in terms 4, 5, and 6. Full term courses are 12 credits and half term courses are 6 credits.

### Capstone (24 Credits)
- The capstone is a culminating project that allows students to use the skills they have learned in ESD in a real-world industry or research project. The capstone projects often focus on interdisciplinary applications, solved by a team of students chosen appropriately from different pillars.

### Electives (72 Credits)
- Electives provide the opportunity for students to customise the ESD degree according to their interests and future careers. At least 24 credits must come from ESD courses (with course code 40.2xx, 40.3xx, 01.02 and 01.107).

### HASS (60 Credits)
- Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) are an essential component of an SUTD degree. HASS courses are required in all but one term of study.

### Extra Courses
- From AY2017 onwards, students who have, and maintain, a GPA of 3.5 or above (and have passed all Freshmore subjects) are eligible to enroll for an additional course in terms 5, 6 and/or 7.

## Specialisation Tracks
The ESD undergraduate programme has been designed with flexibility in mind, so that students can customise their courses to suit their interests and future careers. This flexibility gives you the chance to customise your degree and specialise in the following ESD specialisation tracks:
- Aviation Systems
- Business Analytics & Operations Research
- Financial Services
- Supply Chain & Logistics

With proper study plan, ESD students may complete more than one specialisation track. Pursuing specialisation is optional.

## Career Prospects
ESD graduates are prepared for a wide range of engineering and management careers in various industries, including:
- System/business analysts
- Operations managers
- Project leaders in both the private and public sectors, including healthcare, banking, manufacturing, supply chain, energy, transportation, and entertainment and hospitality.
