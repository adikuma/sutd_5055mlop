Set anchors which represent the attachment points of the cable to the membrane. Set the mass for the particle representing the airdropped supplies. 3. Run the simulation to drop the parachute: Change initial setup parameters to see their effects. 4. Design Emergency Aesthetics: Once the design’s finalised, to personalise the parachute further, for example by mapping colours/images to the mesh (via the custom geometry preview component).
