# Undergraduate Programme

The Undergraduate programme comprises eight academic terms leading to a Bachelor of Science (Architecture and Sustainable Design) degree. Our unique programme structure and hands-on approach to Architecture confers on our students the necessary mix of hard skills and creative thinking to face future challenges in society and Architecture.

## Overview

Our programme consists of core subjects, electives, capstone, option studios and urban sketching.

## Curriculum Structure

### Core Subjects
- **Design Studio**: The heart of the programme, focusing on Design Computation, Building Technology, and History, Theory and Culture.

### Electives
- Addressing emerging challenges such as critical resource constraints, energy-efficient housing, rapid urbanization, transportation planning, historical conservation, and land use transformations.

### Capstone and Option Studios
- Culminating projects for the Bachelor of Science in Architecture and Sustainable Design programme, allowing students to work on real-world problems individually and in interdisciplinary teams.

### Urban Sketching
- Equips students with fundamental sketching skills focusing on urban fabrics and landscapes.
