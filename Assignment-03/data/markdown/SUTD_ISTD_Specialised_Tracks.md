# ISTD Specialisation Tracks - Overview

## Overview
Below is a list of specialisation tracks (also referred to as “concentrations”) available to the students of CSD. Tracks offer students an opportunity to focus in specific sub-areas of CSD. However, a track is not a requirement for students to graduate. A student would be able to graduate as long as he/she fulfills the graduation requirements.

Refer [here](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/01/tracks-intake-Y2020-v6.pdf) for the track overview for Intake Y2020 and subsequent batches.

## Specialisation Track Requirements
**For all tracks**
* 50.001, 50.002, 50.003, 50.004, 50.005, 50.034 are mandatory.
* Track core subjects and 4 track electives (not any electives) are mandatory.
* Students are advised to focus on one track.
* Students are advised to talk to their Academic Mentors/Pillar Administrators to find out more about the track requirements.
