    "markdown": "# Freshmore Subjects\n\nHaving completed a review and revamp, SUTD introduced a new Freshmore curriculum from the AY2020 cohort onwards. Some key elements of the revamped and enhanced curriculum include:\n\n## Foundation\n\nThe first three terms are common to all students and build the foundation in [Science, Mathematics and Technology (SMT)](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/smt), [Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (HASS)](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/hass) and design. This approach provides a broad and rigorous education and aims to provide the students with a strong base to select and excel in their choice of major and also build foundational literacy for future careers and endeavours.\n\nThe incorporation of design projects within and across subjects further imbues design thinking, critical inquiry, problem solving, communication and collaboration skillsets, which are highly relevant and useful in the industry. These 2D design projects will also be reflected in the academic transcript from AY2020 onwards.\n\n### Example of Term 1 2D Design Project\n\n**01.018 Interdisciplinary Design Project**  \n**Project Scenario:**  \nAirdropping medicine and food to an isolated flooded village affected by COVID-19.\n\nThe project is an interdisciplinary effort across 4 different modules:\n1. **Humanities, Arts & Social Sciences (HASS) module:** provides social context to the problem.\n2. **Modelling and Analysis (Math):** Model the air dropping motion of the package with a circular geometry parachute of different radii using optimisation techniques on Excel software.\n3. **Computational Thinking for Design:** Apply geometric modelling and simulation techniques to design the parachute of the emergency supply delivery system (cargo) using computer software.\n4. **Physical World (Physics):** Fabricate a parachute and shock absorption mechanism (force dissipation) to deliver the emergency supplies to the ground safely under two main criteria: (1) cargo should land in the shortest time of flight, and (2) the impact force on landing must be minimised to ensure cargo survivability.\n\nOur students underwent the following stages of this project:\n1. **Modelling a parachute:** Model a flat surface using Rhinoceros 3D and create a mesh from it using Grasshopper. This mesh is analogous to the parachute membrane laid flat on the floor.\n2. **Visual simulation of airdrop:** Set up the physics-based form-finding system. Set anchors which represent the attachment points of the cable to the membrane. Set the mass for the particle representing the airdropped supplies.\n3. **Run the simulation to drop the parachute:** Change initial setup parameters to see their effects.\n4. **Design Emergency Aesthetics:** Once the design’s finalised, to personalise the parachute further, for example by mapping colours/images to the mesh (via the custom geometry preview component). In addition, record an animation of the parachute dropping.\n5. **Inertial Measurement Unit:** The following is the device the students will airdrop in lieu of a cargo with medicine and supplies. The device measures acceleration as function of time.\n\n![Inertial Measurement Unit](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/interdisciplinary-design-project.jpg)\n\n## Extension of Grade-Free System\n\nIn addition to all subjects in Term 1 being grade-free (Pass/No Record), students can choose up to four more subjects from Terms 2 and 3 to be grade-free. With this arrangement, you can better adjust to academic life at SUTD, explore new areas that you are interested in or embrace learning subjects that you have no prior background in without worrying about grades.\n\n## Flexibility to Pursue Interests\n\nStudents are allowed to choose any 2 of the following 4 elective modules in Term 3, to provide them with more options to pursue their own educational interests:\n- Science and Technology for Healthcare\n- Data Driven World\n- Designing Energy Systems\n- Spatial Design World\n\n## Computational Design Courses\n\nComputational Thinking for Design (Term 1) and Spatial Design World (Term 3 elective module) are newly designed modules to strengthen students’ digital literacy in preparation for the data-driven world.\n\n## Mathematics and Physics\n\nThe following core modules were developed with increased correlation between Mathematics and Physics in mind, with enhanced linkages and translation to the majors:\n\n### Term 1:\n- [Modelling and Analysis](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-013-modelling-and-analysis/)\n- [Physical World](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-015-physical-world/)\n\n### Term 2:\n- [Modelling Space and Systems](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-018-modelling-space-and-systems/)\n- [Technological World](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-017-technological-world/)\n\n### Term 3:\n- [Modelling Uncertainty](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-022-modelling-uncertainty/)\n- [Global Humanities: Literature, Philosophy, and Ethics (HASS)](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/02-003-social-science-understanding-behaviour-culture-society/)\n- Any two electives:\n  - [Science and Technology for Healthcare](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-019-science-and-technology-for-healthcare-elective/) – Elective\n  - [Data Driven World](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-020/data-driven-world-elective/) – Elective\n  - [Designing Energy Systems](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-023/designing-energy-systems-elective/) – Elective\n  - [Spatial Design World](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-024/spatial-design-world/) – Elective\n\n## Chemistry and Biology\n\nScience for a Sustainable World (Term 2) and Science and Technology for Healthcare (Term 3 elective module) have been designed based on current and relevant themes that are driven from the point of view of the Sciences.\n\n## List of Freshmore Subjects\n\n### Term 1\n- [Modelling and Analysis](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-013-modelling-and-analysis/)\n- [Physical World](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-015-physical-world/)\n- [Computational Thinking for Design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-014-computational-thinking-for-design/)\n- [Social Science: Understanding Behaviour, Culture & Society (HASS)](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/02-001-global-humanities-literature-philosophy-and-ethics/)\n\n### Term 2\n- [Modelling Space and Systems](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-018-modelling-space-and-systems/)\n- [Technological World](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-017-technological-world/)\n- [Science for a Sustainable World](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-016-science-for-a-sustainable-world/)\n- [Design Thinking and Innovation](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/03-007/design-thinking-and-innovation/)\n\n### Term 3\n- [Modelling Uncertainty](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-022-modelling-uncertainty/)\n- [Global Humanities: Literature, Philosophy, and Ethics (HASS)](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/02-003-social-science-understanding-behaviour-culture-society/)\n- Any two electives:\n  - [Science and Technology for Healthcare](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-019-science-and-technology-for-healthcare-elective/) – Elective\n  - [Data Driven World](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-020/data-driven-world-elective/) – Elective\n  - [Designing Energy Systems](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-023/designing-energy-systems-elective/) – Elective\n  - [Spatial Design World](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-024/spatial-design-world/) – Elective\n"

    "markdown": "# ISTD Curriculum\n\nUnder the ISTD Pillar, we offer Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Science and Design). CSD was previously known as Bachelor of Engineering (Information Systems Technology and Design). The decision to change the programme name to CSD aims to accurately reflect the computing-intensive curriculum that students have undergone in the ISTD pillar.\n\n## Curriculum Overview\n\n### CSD Core (60 Credits)\nCSD core courses are offered every year in Term 4 and 5. These are mandatory courses for all CSD students. The five subjects aim to equip students with basic computational and mathematical tools needed for problem solving using computers and to instil algorithmic thinking.\n\n### Electives (96 Credits)\nElectives provide the opportunity for students to customise the ISTD degree according to their interests and future careers.\n- AY2019 ISTD students are required to take a minimum of 4 ISTD electives in order to graduate from the ISTD degree.\n- AY2020 ISTD students (and subsequent batches) are required to take a minimum of 5 ISTD electives in order to graduate from the ISTD degree.\n\n### HASS (60 Credits)\nHumanities, Arts and Social Sciences (HASS) are essential components of an SUTD degree. Students are required to take a HASS elective every term from Term 4 onwards.\n\n### Capstone (24 Credits)\nThe capstone is a culminating project that allows students to use the skills they have learned in ISTD in a real world industry or research project. The capstone projects often focus on interdisciplinary applications, solved by a team of students chosen appropriately from different pillars.\n\n### Extra Courses\nFrom AY2017 onwards, students who have, and maintain a CGPA of 3.5 or above (and passed all Freshmore subjects) are eligible to enrol for an additional course in Term 5, 6 or 7. Subject to the prerequisites and timing of the course, students may use this flexibility to take an additional HASS or elective course.\n\n## Course Sequence\nThe following diagram depicts the typical sequence of courses in the CSD curriculum. Each column from left to right represents the Spring (Jan-Apr), Summer (May-Aug) and Fall (Sept-Dec) terms respectively. SUTD students choose their pillar at the end of Term 3, and begin their pillar studies in Term 4.\n\n## Important Dates\n- **Application Deadlines:** Check the academic calendar for specific dates.\n\n## Contact Information\n- **Phone:** +65 6303 6600\n- **Email:** [Contact ISTD](mailto:istd@sutd.edu.sg)\n\n## Additional Resources\n- [Academic Calendar](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/istd/education/undergraduate/academic-calendar/overview/ay2024-onwards/)\n- [SUTD Courses](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/istd/education/undergraduate/courses/)"

    "markdown": "# ESD Curriculum - AY2020 Onwards\n\n## Overview\nThe ESD undergraduate degree delivers a programme that is broad, with opportunities for acquiring in-depth knowledge in specific application areas. The ESD core consists of rigorous methodology courses, which provide the technical foundation necessary to model, analyse, and manage large-scale complex systems. Students supplement this core by choosing from a variety of elective courses depending on their interests. Students may also specialise in a specific specialisation track by choosing elective courses related to the track.\n\n## By the Numbers\n\n### ESD Core (84 Credits)\nThe ESD core is composed of courses focused on various methods for analysis and modelling of engineering systems. These courses are offered every year in terms 4, 5, and 6. Full term courses are 12 credits and half term courses are 6 credits.\n\n### Capstone (24 Credits)\nThe capstone is a culminating project that allows students to use the skills they have learned in ESD in a real-world industry or research project. The capstone projects often focus on interdisciplinary applications, solved by a team of students chosen appropriately from different pillars.\n\n### Electives (72 Credits)\nElectives provide the opportunity for students to customise the ESD degree according to their interests and future careers. Electives compose 72 credits of the ESD undergraduate programme, from which at least 24 credits must come from ESD courses (with course code 40.2xx, 40.3xx, 01.02 and 01.107).\n\n### HASS (60 Credits)\nHumanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) are an essential component of an SUTD degree. HASS courses are required in all but one term of study. It is strongly recommended that ESD students supplement their technical engineering programme with HASS electives that build competence in economic reasoning.\n\n### Extra Courses\nFrom AY2017 onwards, students who have, and maintain, a GPA of 3.5 or above (and have passed all Freshmore subjects) are eligible to enroll for an additional course in terms 5, 6 and/or 7.\n\n## Specialisation Tracks\nThe ESD undergraduate programme has been designed with flexibility in mind, allowing students to customise their courses to suit their interests and future careers. The following specialisation tracks are available:\n- Aviation Systems\n- Business Analytics & Operations Research\n- Financial Services\n- Supply Chain & Logistics\n\nWith proper study plan, ESD students may complete more than one specialisation track. Pursuing specialisation is optional.\n\n## Skills and Career Prospects\nESD students will graduate with an analytical mindset when dealing with problems of business and operations, supplemented by the orientation toward design. ESD graduates are prepared for a wide range of engineering and management careers in various industries, including:\n- System/business analysts\n- Operations managers\n- Project leaders\n\n## Important Dates\n- **Application Deadlines:** Check the [Admissions page](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/esd/admissions) for specific dates.\n- **Academic Calendar:** For details about school terms, vacation periods, and more, visit the [Academic Calendar](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/esd/education/undergraduate/academic-calendar/overview/ay2024-onwards/).\n\n## Resources\nFor more information about the ESD curriculum for students enrolled in year 2019 and earlier, visit [here](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/esd/education/undergraduate/curriculum/until-ay2019/)."
