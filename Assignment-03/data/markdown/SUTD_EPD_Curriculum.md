### Frequently Asked Questions
1. **I have received and accepted SUTD’s undergraduate admissions offer. Does my relevant diploma give me a higher chance of enrolling in EPD?**  
   Students enrolled in SUTD’s undergraduate programme will start year 1 with our common Freshmore curriculum. You are only required to select your choice of major at the end of Term 3. The qualification you have used during admissions application will not be referenced at this point. Based on past statistics, most students will be confirmed for your choice of major.

2. **Must I be good at physics to do well in EPD?**  
   At SUTD, all first-year students go through a mandatory Freshmore curriculum which comprises foundational courses which include Physics. This approach provides a broad and rigorous education, and ensures that all students build a strong foundation in Science, Mathematics, Technology and Design to excel in your chosen major (such as EPD).

3. **What type of students are you looking out for?**  
   The EPD curriculum emphasizes hands-on physical prototyping, making it ideal for students who are inclined towards collaborative, practical work and creating tangible products to be both a suitable and rewarding choice.
