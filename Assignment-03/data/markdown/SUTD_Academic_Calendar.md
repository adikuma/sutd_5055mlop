## Important Dates and Events

* **Before term starts in January**, during the special term, SUTD students are encouraged to participate in the following:
  * **Independent Activity Period (IAP)** – This is a special three-week period where students, faculty members and staff can organise activities for the SUTD community. The aim of the IAP programme is to promote proactivity, creativity, interactivity and vibrancy among the SUTD community.
  * **Undergraduate Practice Opportunities Programme (UPOP)** – Find out more information about [UPOP](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/campus-life/undergraduate-opportunities-programme/upop/).

* **Global Exchange Programme (GEXP)**: Students who embark on GEXP will transfer credits for Term 6 courses, except for ASD students who will transfer credits for Terms 7 and/or 8 courses. Students who embark on GEXP in Year 3 Sep – Dec (after Term 5) may opt to extend their stay in the host destination with an overseas internship (only for selected destinations), or undertake a 6 to 8 months internship (Year 3 Jan – Year 4 Aug). Students who embark on GEXP in Term 6 may choose to extend their stay in the host destination with an overseas internship in Year 4 May – Aug. ASD students will only be allowed to embark on GEXP in Year 3 Sep – Dec (after Term 5) as they must complete Term 6 in SUTD. Refer to the [GEXP page](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/campus-life/global-experience-and-exchange/student-exchange/outbound/global-exchange-programme-gexp/) for more details.
