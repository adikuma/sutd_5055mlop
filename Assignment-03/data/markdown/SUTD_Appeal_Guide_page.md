# Appeal

SUTD’s holistic admissions approach means our Admissions team reads through every application and supporting information that you share with us. We endeavour to provide as many opportunities as possible, but in such a way that our students have a good fit and a meaningful experience during your university journey.

If after SUTD’s admission decision, you think that there was something potentially useful you left out or did not communicate as clearly with us, you are welcome to submit an appeal.

You can do this via the application portal between **9 May 2025 and 23 May 2025**.

If you had applied with predicted results (except predicted International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma), you are required to upload your final results within 3 days after the results are released, before we can consider the appeal.

If you had applied with **predicted International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma** results and wish to appeal, you may submit an online appeal with your actual IB results between **5 July 2025 and 11 July 2025**.

In your appeal, please share **significant and compelling** academic and/or personal information that was not available at the time of application and which could help us better understand your fit for SUTD.

Only applicants who have submitted an application in the current admissions exercise, and have received notice from SUTD of the outcome, may submit an appeal.

Appeals can only be [submitted here](https://admission.sutd.edu.sg/psc/CSADM1PRD/APPLICANT/HRMS/c/N_ADMISSIONS.N_AD_APPLUG_APL.GBL?&) after logging into the SUTD Admissions System. Appeals via any other channels will not be considered.
