The project is an interdisciplinary effort across 4 different modules: 1. Humanities, Arts & Social Sciences (HASS) module: provides social context to the problem. 2. Modelling and Analysis (Math): Model the air dropping motion of the package with a circular geometry parachute of different radii using optimisation techniques on Excel software. 3. Computational Thinking for Design: Apply geometric modelling and simulation techniques to design the parachute of the emergency supply delivery system (cargo) using computer software. 4. Physical World (Physics): Fabricate a parachute and shock absorption mechanism (force dissipation) to deliver the emergency supplies to the ground safely under two main criteria: (1) cargo should land in the shortest time of flight, and (2) the impact force on landing must be minimised to ensure cargo survivability. Our students underwent the following stages of this project: 1. Modelling a parachute: Model a flat surface using Rhinoceros 3D and create a mesh from it using Grasshopper. This mesh is analogous to the parachute membrane laid flat on the floor. 2. Visual simulation of airdrop: Set up the physics-based form-finding system. Set anchors which represent the attachment points of the cable to the membrane. Set the mass for the particle representing the airdropped supplies. 3. Run the simulation to drop the parachute: Change initial setup parameters to see their effects. 4. Design Emergency Aesthetics: Once the design’s finalised, to personalise the parachute further, for example by mapping colours/images to the mesh (via the custom geometry preview component). In addition, record an animation of the parachute dropping. 5. Inertial Measurement Unit: The following is the device the students will airdrop in lieu of a cargo with medicine and supplies.

"The study of engineering systems concerns the design, planning, and operations of large scale complex systems. Examples of engineering systems include transportation systems, supply chain and logistics, defence systems, energy systems, financial services and healthcare systems. The ESD undergraduate degree delivers a programme that is broad, with opportunities for acquiring in-depth knowledge in specific application areas. The ESD core consists of rigorous methodology courses, which provide the technical foundation necessary to design, analyse, and optimise systems. Students supplement this core by choosing from a variety of elective courses depending on their interests. They may also specialise in specialisation track(s) by choosing the elective courses related to the track. For more details, please refer to ESD Undergraduate programme.",SUTD ESD Courses,https://www.sutd.edu.sg/esd/education/undergraduate/courses/#tabs,Lists the courses available within the Engineering Systems and Design (ESD) pillar.,NarrativeText,Overview,['https://www.sutd.edu.sg/esd/contact-us/'],ESD
"The ESD undergraduate programme has been designed with flexibility in mind, so that students can customise their courses to suit their interests and future careers. This flexibility gives you the chance to customise your degree and specialise in the following ESD specialisation tracks: Aviation Systems Business Analytics & Operations Research Financial Services Supply Chain & Logistics With proper study plan, ESD students may complete more than one specialisation track.

"ESD students will graduate with an analytical mindset when dealing with problems of business and operations, supplemented by the orientation toward design. You will be experienced in communicating and working with clients, and presenting your technical ideas effectively and persuasively. You will be skilled at transforming data into models and using those models to influence major decisions. ESD graduates are prepared for a wide range of engineering and management careers in a variety of industries, namely system/business analysts, operations managers, and project leaders in both the private and public sectors, including healthcare, banking, manufacturing, supply chain, energy, transportation, and entertainment and hospitality. Your career progression depends on the industry, company, and activity. For example, in a consulting company, you might expect to follow the path of “analyst-consultant-partner,” in a business you might follow “analyst-manager-director,” in an engineering firm you might follow “engineer-leader-manager-director,” and so on.",SUTD ESD Courses,https://www.sutd.edu.sg/esd/education/undergraduate/courses/#tabs,Lists the courses available within the Engineering Systems and Design (ESD) pillar.,NarrativeText,Skills and Career Prospects,['https://www.sutd.edu.sg/esd/contact-us/'],ESD

The minor will be accorded upon successful completion of the required subjects by Term 8. No extension beyond Term 8 is allowed. Students interested in pursuing a minor or minors are required to meet an academic advisor to formulate a study plan. Students who are deemed to be unable to complete the coursework by Term 8 should not embark on a minor programme. Students will indicate their choice of Minor at the start of Term 8. Both the Major and Minor requirements must be completed within the normal candidature of the undergraduate programme, i.e. 8 terms. Subsequently, students are required to track their own progress towards completing the minor programme(s) as per the study plan formulated.
