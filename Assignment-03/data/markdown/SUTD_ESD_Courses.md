# ESD Courses

## Undergraduate Programme

### Overview
The study of engineering systems concerns the design, planning, and operations of large scale complex systems. Examples of engineering systems include transportation systems, supply chain and logistics, defence systems, energy systems, financial services and healthcare systems.

The ESD undergraduate degree delivers a programme that is broad, with opportunities for acquiring in-depth knowledge in specific application areas. The ESD core consists of rigorous methodology courses, which provide the technical foundation necessary to design, analyse, and optimise systems. Students supplement this core by choosing from a variety of elective courses depending on their interests. They may also specialise in specialisation track(s) by choosing the elective courses related to the track.

For more details, please refer to [ESD Undergraduate programme](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/esd/education/undergraduate/curriculum/beyond-ay-2019/).

### Specialisations
The ESD undergraduate programme has been designed with flexibility in mind, so that students can customise their courses to suit their interests and future careers. This flexibility gives you the chance to customise your degree and specialise in the following ESD specialisation tracks:

* Aviation Systems
* Business Analytics & Operations Research
* Financial Services
* Supply Chain & Logistics

With proper study plan, ESD students may complete more than one specialisation track. Pursuing specialisation is optional.

### Skills and Career Prospects
ESD students will graduate with an analytical mindset when dealing with problems of business and operations, supplemented by the orientation toward design. You will be experienced in communicating and working with clients, and presenting your technical ideas effectively and persuasively. You will be skilled at transforming data into models and using those models to influence major decisions.

ESD graduates are prepared for a wide range of engineering and management careers in a variety of industries, namely system/business analysts, operations managers, and project leaders in both the private and public sectors, including healthcare, banking, manufacturing, supply chain, energy, transportation, and entertainment and hospitality.

Your career progression depends on the industry, company, and activity. For example, in a consulting company, you might expect to follow the path of “analyst-consultant-partner,” in a business you might follow “analyst-manager-director,” in an engineering firm you might follow “engineer-leader-manager-director,” and so on.
