Examples of engineering systems include transportation systems, supply chain and logistics, defence systems, energy systems, financial services and healthcare systems.</p>\n<p>The ESD undergraduate degree delivers a programme that is broad, with opportunities for acquiring in-depth knowledge in specific application areas. The ESD core consists of rigorous methodology courses, which provide the technical foundation necessary to design, analyse, and optimise systems. Students supplement this core by choosing from a variety of elective courses depending on their interests. They may also specialise in specialisation track(s) by choosing the elective courses related to the track.</p>\n<p>For more details, please refer to <a href=\"https://www.sutd.edu.sg/esd/education/undergraduate/curriculum/beyond-ay-2019/\">ESD Undergraduate programme</a>.</p>",

Students may choose to follow one of four tracks. These specialisation tracks provide exposure to specific industries and are composed of three elective courses usually taken in terms 6, 7, and 8. Students who complete a specialisation track will have it indicated on their transcript so that future employers can recognise this expertise. Choosing a specialisation track is optional and students are expected to discuss their elective choices with their faculty advisor.</p>",
